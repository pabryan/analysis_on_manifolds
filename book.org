#+Title: Analysis on manifolds

* Notes								   :noexport:

- Alternative titles: Geometric PDE, Invariant PDE (elliptic and parabolic, hyperbolic?)

* Bundles

** The Tangent Bundle 
** Vector Bundles 
- motivated by tangent bundle
- Tensor bundles
- differential forms
- $E$ valued differential forms
** Principal Bundles 
- motivated by Frame Bundle
- these are the symmetry groups of frame bundles! Uniquely determined by transition functions determining the bundle
** Fibre bundles
- Especially important for immersion/embeddings, harmonic maps, MCF etc.
  \[
  \Gamma(M \times N) = C^{\infty}(M \to N)
  \]
  and $N$ need not have any particular structure beyond being a smooth manifold.
** Sheaves of Sections
- Correspond one-to-one with bundles
- Structure sheaf determines manifold
- local operations act on sections/germs
** Jet bundles
- This is where differentiabiliy is defined! It's just the bundle associated to the the sheaf of germs
- used for the $h$-principle
- used also for interpreting connections and differential operators

* Connections and Curvature
- Splitting exact sequence $0 \to VE \to TE \to TM \to 0$  (vertical/ horizontal) in particular to differentiate a section \(s : M \to E\) we get \(ds : TM \to TE\) and a splitting gives exactly the required map $TE \to  E \simeq VE$.
- pull back
- as sections of jet bundles
- covariant derivatives 
- connection form
- moduli space of connections
- curvature form
* ODE

- warm up for PDE theory
- some function spaces like Holder spaces needed for ODE's?
- first order linear, flows and vector fields
- second order is a system of first order ODE's on TM e.g. geodesic flow 
- local existence and uniqueness - first local flow box and then give a global type intrinsic proof

* Functional Analysis

- Measurable functions
- L^p spaces 
- Sobolev spaces
- Holder spaces
- Interpolation spaces
- BV functions
- Besov spaces etc.? See Palais book on nonlinear analysis
- Sections are not always into a linear space - eg an immersion $M \to N$ with not a linear space so need to consult Hamilton and Andrews on Nash-Moser implicit function theorem. The point is to work in Frechet otlr convex spaces etc.

* Differential operators
- see Slovak et. al. Natural Operations
- Index etc.?
- linearisation and symbol
- jet bundles again
- traces, symmetric functions etc.
* Gauge Invariance
- All our equations have some sort of geometric invariance and/or diffeomorphism invariance
- This is a super important aspect of the situation
- Discuss gauge transformation and gauge fixing
* Existence and Uniqueness

- Implicit function Thm
- de Turk
- Gauge invariance and degeneracy of symbol

* Regularity Theory
- Where to go for this?
* Examples
- MCF
- Ricci flow
- Yang-Mills
- Harmonic maps
- Dirac stuff?
- Whitney immersion
- Nash embeddings
- h-principle? Smale spher eversion for example
- Perelman
* Maximum Principles
- For elliptic and parabolic equations
- Krein-Rutman type approach - preserving cones etc.
* Estimates
- local estimates
- a priori estimates
- Higher derivative and smoothing estimates
- Shi estimates...
* Calculus of Variations
- Functionals
- Variations
- Linearisation
- Convexity!
- monotone functionals
* Convergence Results
- Hamilton Ricci flow
- Huisken MCF
- Eels and Sampson
